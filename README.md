# driveslow

if you drive slow...can you ski fast?

## background

can we use data from a variety of sources, like traffic webcams, weather and seasonality to predict how long it'll take to get up to ski in Tahoe region and how crowded it'll be?

## developing

you'll need python3.10ish, trying to keep minimal dependencies for now
